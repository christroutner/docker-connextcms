# docker-connextcms
A Dockerfile used to create a Docker Image for running ConnextCMS and KeystoneJS in a Docker Container

This repository contains two Dockerfiles and a docker-compose file. The Dockerfile in this root directory will 
create a Docker image
with a functional version of ConnextCMS and KeystoneJS. It depends on the official `mongo` Docker image,
and a repository of pre-compiled KeystoneJS code generated by the second Docker image.

A second Dockerfile exists in the `buildFromSource` directory. This creates an environment ready to run
the `yo keystone` command to build KeystoneJS from scratch. This environment is used to create and update
the [keystone4-compiled](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/keystone4-compiled) repository used by the first 
Dockerfile.

## Installation
It's assumed that you are starting with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a 64-bit machine. 
It's also assumed that you are installing as a [non-root user with sudo privileges](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04). 

1. Install Docker on the host system. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)
shows how to install Docker on a Ubuntu 16.04 system. It's specifically targeted to Digital Ocean's cloud servers, but
should work for any Ubuntnu system.
Use [this link](https://m.do.co/c/8f47a23b91ce) to sign up for a Digital Ocean account and get a $10 credit, capable of
running a $5 server for two months.

2. Install Docker Compose too. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04)
shows how to do so on a Ubuntu system.

3. Clone this repository in your home directory with the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/skagitpublishing/docker-connextcms`

4. (Optional) Add any [plugins](http://connextcms.com/page/plugins) or your own customized [plugin-template](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/plugin-template-connextcms) 
to the `plugins` directory. Or add your own
customized [site-template](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/site-template-connextcms) 
to the `theme` directory. Be sure to edit the `mergeandlaunch` script to execute each merge
script required to merge your plugins and site files into [ConnextCMS Core](https://github.com/skagitpublishing/connextCMS) 
at load time.

5. Bring ConnextCMS/KeystoneJS online by running the following command:
`docker-compose up -d`

Docker will build the ConnextCMS Docker image and launch it. At the end, KeystoneJS will be running on port 3000, 
with ConnextCMS running with it. For additional information on how to setup a production server with this container,
[see the three-part video series on ConnextCMS.com](http://connextcms.com/page/videos).
